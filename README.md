# cmake_bestPractise

# Why
The reason for this repository is the fact that I found no good example in the internet about how to use cmake.
Most examples were confusing, too much complicated or just wrong.

# What
Here is what I would like to find as example. The example consits of one main linking one sub module linking another sub module. This should be sufficient to transfer to any size of project.
There are some comments at the commands used to explain them.

# How
The example is runnable at Ubuntu out of the box. Just pull it and run the build.sh script.
